'''
Remove n Elements from the Given Index
Write a function remove_n_elems_from_index that takes a tuple t, an integer n, and an index i as input. The function should return a new tuple with the n elements starting at index i removed. If the index i is out of bounds, return the original tuple.

NOTE: This is a function type question, you don't have to take input or print the output, just have to complete the required function definition.

Examples

>>> remove_n_elems_from_index((1, 2, 3, 4, 5), 2, 1)
(1, 4, 5)
>>> remove_n_elems_from_index((10, 20, 30, 40, 50), 3, 2)
(10, 20, 30)
>>> remove_n_elems_from_index((1, 2, 3, 4, 5), 5, 0)
